## Milestone Summary

**Key Decisions:**

- Astro over WordPress: Performance, security, developer control
- Tailwind v4 CSS-first tokens: No config file, @theme directives
- Markdown over Strapi CMS: Shared hosting can't run Node.js
- Third-party gallery service (Pic-Time): Purpose-built for photographers
- Static site on shared hosting: Uses existing InMotion hosting
- astro-swiper custom element: Self-initializing, no client:load needed
- PhotoSwipe for lightbox: Keyboard + touch + View Transitions compatible
- Resend for email: Simple API, works with Astro Actions
- Fuse.js for search: Client-side fuzzy search, no server needed

**Issues Resolved:**

- SkeletonCard shimmer integrated into FeaturedImage as loading backdrop
- Phase 4 verification report created retroactively
- SEO configured for Prescott, AZ region with GA4 tracking
- PhotoSwipe/carousel cleanup on View Transitions navigation
- Dark mode persistence across View Transitions via astro:after-swap
- Mobile theme toggle selector fix for multiple components

**Issues Deferred:**

- Replace placeholder images with real photography (content preparation)
- Configure Resend API key and CONTACT_EMAIL for production
- Confirm Pic-Time subdomain URL
- DNS verification for custom email sender domain

**Technical Debt Incurred:**

- Pre-existing type error in astro.config.mjs (Vite plugin type mismatch) -- does not affect builds
- Native browser dropdown popup has light background in dark mode on Chrome Mac (OS-level limitation)
