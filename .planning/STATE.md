### Pending Todos

- Replace placeholder hero images with real photography when available

### Blockers/Concerns

- Content preparation (96-160 curated images + alt text for 8 categories) is the primary timeline risk
- Pre-existing type error in astro.config.mjs (Vite plugin type mismatch) -- does not affect builds
- Native browser dropdown popup on Chrome Mac has light background in dark mode (OS-level rendering limitation)
