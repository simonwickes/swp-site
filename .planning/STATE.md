## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [Roadmap]: Astro 5.17 + Tailwind v4 + Sharp image pipeline as foundation
- [Roadmap]: Content preparation runs as parallel track starting Phase 1
- [Roadmap]: Gallery service selection decision needed before Phase 5
- [01-01]: Tailwind v4 via @tailwindcss/vite (not @astrojs/tailwind)
- [01-01]: CSS-first tokens in @theme -- no tailwind.config.js
- [01-01]: Selector-based dark mode with @custom-variant dark and .dark class
- [01-01]: theme-ready class defers transitions to prevent initial flash
- [01-01]: TypeScript path aliases (@/*, @components/*, @layouts/*, @styles/*)

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- Content preparation (96-160 curated images + alt text for 8 categories) is the primary timeline risk -- must start during Phase 1
- Gallery service selection (Pixieset vs Pic-Time) decision needed before Phase 5
