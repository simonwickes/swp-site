<objective>
Audit and update all image alt text to follow the SEO-focused pattern ("X photography in [location] by Simon Wickes") and ensure all remaining pages (Home, Contact, Galleries, Blog listing) have optimized meta descriptions. This is the final polish pass before launch.

Purpose: Descriptive alt text improves Google Image search visibility and accessibility. Consistent meta descriptions across all pages ensure professional appearance in search results. This plan completes the SEO optimization for launch readiness.

Output: 5 modified files with updated alt text and meta descriptions (HeroCarousel handled in Plan 08-02)

  <name>Task 1: Update alt text on featured grid images</name>
  <files>
    src/components/home/FeaturedGrid.astro
  </files>
  <action>
  NOTE: HeroCarousel alt text updates are handled in Plan 08-02 Task 2 to avoid file conflicts.

  Modify `src/components/home/FeaturedGrid.astro`:

  Read the current file first to understand the FeaturedGrid structure. The featured items likely have alt text per image. Update each featured item's alt text to follow the pattern: `"${category} photography in Arizona by Simon Wickes"`.

  If FeaturedGrid generates alt text dynamically from service data, update the pattern. If it uses static alt text per item, update each one. The goal: every image rendered by FeaturedGrid should have alt text containing the photographer name and service type.

  NOTE on service page galleries: The 8 service pages already use the pattern `${service.title} photography by Simon Wickes` for their gallery image alt text (confirmed in weddings.astro pattern). No changes needed for service gallery images.

  - `npm run build` succeeds
  - Check homepage HTML: FeaturedGrid `<img>` tags should have alt attributes containing "by Simon Wickes"
  - Verify no featured grid images have empty or generic alt text

    src/pages/blog/[...page].astro
  </files>
  <action>
  Modify `src/pages/index.astro`:

  Update PageLayout to include the SEO-optimized description from RESEARCH.md:
  ```astro
  <PageLayout
    title="Home"
    description="Simon Wickes Photography -- professional photographer in Arizona specializing in portraits, weddings, commercial, and landscape photography."
  >
  ```
  The "Home" title will render as just "Simon Wickes Photography" (no "Home |" prefix) thanks to the SEOHead logic from Plan 01.

  Modify `src/pages/contact.astro`:

  The description is already set ("Get in touch with Simon Wickes Photography for bookings and enquiries.") but update it to match the RESEARCH.md recommendation more closely:
  ```astro
  <PageLayout
    title="Contact"
    description="Get in touch with Simon Wickes Photography. Book a session or ask about availability for portraits, weddings, and events in Arizona."
  >
  ```

  Modify `src/pages/galleries.astro`:

  The description already exists but update to match RESEARCH.md recommendation:
  ```astro
  <PageLayout
    title="Client Galleries"
    description="Access your password-protected photo gallery from Simon Wickes Photography. View, download, and share your images at full resolution."
  >
  ```

  Modify `src/pages/blog/[...page].astro`:

  Read the file first to check its current structure. The blog listing page should have a description. Add or update:
  ```astro
  <PageLayout
    title="Blog"
    description="Photography stories, behind-the-scenes insights, and tips from Simon Wickes Photography in Arizona."
  >
  ```

  All descriptions should be under 155 characters. Verify by counting.
  </action>
  <verify>
  - `npm run build` succeeds
  - Check homepage HTML: `<meta name="description"` contains the full Arizona-focused description
  - Check contact page: description mentions booking and Arizona
  - Check galleries page: description mentions password-protected gallery
  - Check blog listing: description mentions photography stories
  - Verify no description exceeds 155 characters
  </verify>
  <done>All pages across the site have distinct, SEO-optimized meta descriptions under 155 characters. Image alt text audit complete with consistent "by Simon Wickes" pattern.</done>
