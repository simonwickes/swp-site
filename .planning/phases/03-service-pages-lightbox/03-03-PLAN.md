  <name>Task 1: Automated pre-checks</name>
  <files></files>
  <action>
    Run automated verification before human review:

    1. `npx astro build` -- must succeed
    2. Count generated pages: check build output for all 8 service category pages + services index
    3. Verify PhotoSwipe is in the build output: check for photoswipe references in dist/
    4. Check all service pages have the expected structure:
       - Grep each page for ServiceNav, ServiceHero, ServiceGallery imports
       - Grep each page for import.meta.glob (static path)
       - Grep each page for getServiceBySlug
    5. Start preview server: `npx astro preview &`
    6. Verify all 8 service URLs return 200 status (curl each /services/{slug}/)
    7. Verify services index returns 200

    Report results before proceeding to human verification.

  <verify>Build succeeds, all pages return 200, structure checks pass.</verify>

  <what-built>8 service category pages with masonry gallery grids, PhotoSwipe lightbox, horizontal service nav, hero sections with descriptions and CTA buttons.</what-built>
  <how-to-verify>
    With the preview server running (`npx astro preview`):

    **Service Pages (check at least 3 different categories):**
    1. Visit http://localhost:4321/services/weddings/
    2. Verify: Hero section shows service title, description, and "Contact me" button
    3. Verify: Horizontal service nav bar shows all 8 categories with "Weddings" highlighted
    4. Verify: Gallery grid shows placeholder images in masonry layout
    5. Click a gallery image -- lightbox should open with solid black background
    6. Verify lightbox: No image counter visible, no captions
    7. Press arrow keys -- should navigate between images
    8. Wait ~4 seconds -- controls should fade out (auto-hide)
    9. Move mouse -- controls should reappear
    10. Click the black background area -- should NOT close (no backdrop close)
    11. Press Escape -- lightbox should close
    12. Click "Contact me" button -- should navigate to /contact/
    13. Click a different category in the service nav -- should navigate to that category page

    **Responsive Layout:**
    14. Resize browser to mobile width (~375px) -- gallery should be 1 column
    15. Resize to tablet (~768px) -- gallery should be 2 columns
    16. Resize to desktop (~1200px) -- gallery should be 4 columns

    **Services Index:**
    17. Visit http://localhost:4321/services/ -- should show all 8 categories as cards
    18. Click any card -- should navigate to the correct service page

    **Dark Mode:**
    19. Toggle dark mode -- all service page elements should adapt correctly
