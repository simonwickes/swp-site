<objective>
Add Client Galleries navigation links to the site header (desktop and mobile) and footer, then verify the complete phase visually.

Purpose: Users must be able to discover and navigate to the galleries page from anywhere on the site. Without navigation links, the page exists but is effectively hidden. This completes the GALL-01 and GALL-02 requirements by making the galleries page accessible through all navigation paths.

Output: Updated Header.astro and Footer.astro with Client Galleries links, plus visual verification of the complete phase.

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 1: Add Client Galleries link to Header and Footer navigation</name>
  <files>src/components/global/Header.astro, src/components/global/Footer.astro</files>
  <action>
**Header.astro -- Desktop navigation (line ~73-160 area, inside the `<MenuItems>` `<ul>`):**

Add a new `<li>` for "Client Galleries" between the Services dropdown `</li>` (closes around line 146) and the Contact `<li>` (starts around line 147). Use the exact same link pattern as the existing Home and Contact links:

```astro
<li>
  <a
    href="/galleries/"
    class:list={[
      "rounded-lg px-3 py-2 text-sm font-medium transition-colors hover:text-accent-500",
      isActive("/galleries/")
        ? "text-accent-500"
        : "text-surface-600 dark:text-surface-400",
    ]}
  >
    Client Galleries
  </a>
</li>
```

**Header.astro -- Mobile navigation (line ~244-312 area, inside the mobile slide-in panel):**

Add a "Client Galleries" link in the bottom section, between the service groups and the Contact link. Specifically, add it BEFORE the Contact link `<div class="border-t ...">` section (around line 290). Add it as its own bordered section to visually separate it from the services list:

```astro
<!-- Client Galleries link -->
<div class="border-t border-surface-200 pt-4 dark:border-surface-800">
  <a
    href="/galleries/"
    class:list={[
      "block rounded-lg px-3 py-2.5 text-base font-medium transition-colors hover:text-accent-500",
      isActive("/galleries/")
        ? "text-accent-500"
        : "text-surface-700 dark:text-surface-300",
    ]}
  >
    Client Galleries
  </a>
</div>
```

CRITICAL: The Header has TWO completely separate nav sections -- `hidden lg:block` for desktop and `lg:hidden` for mobile. You MUST update BOTH. Missing either one causes navigation inconsistency between viewport sizes.

**Footer.astro:**

Add a "Client Galleries" link in the footer links area (the `<div class="flex items-center gap-6">` section), between the Instagram icon and the Contact link:

```astro
<a
  href="/galleries/"
  class="text-sm text-surface-500 transition-colors hover:text-accent-500"
>
  Galleries
</a>
```

Use "Galleries" (shorter) in the footer for brevity, consistent with "Contact" being shorter than "Contact Me" in the footer.

- `npx astro build` succeeds with no errors
- `npx astro dev` and inspect the built HTML:
  - Desktop nav contains an anchor with `href="/galleries/"` between Services and Contact
  - Mobile slide-in panel contains an anchor with `href="/galleries/"`
  - Footer contains an anchor with `href="/galleries/"`
- Navigate to `/galleries/` -- the "Client Galleries" link shows active state (text-accent-500) in both desktop and mobile nav
- Navigate to `/` -- the "Client Galleries" link shows inactive state in both desktop and mobile nav
  </verify>
  <done>
- "Client Galleries" link appears in desktop header navigation between Services and Contact
- "Client Galleries" link appears in mobile slide-in panel between Services section and Contact
- "Galleries" link appears in footer alongside Instagram and Contact
- Active state highlights correctly on the /galleries/ page
- All links use correct dark mode text colors

  <name>Task 2: Visual verification of complete Client Galleries phase</name>
  <what-built>Complete Client Galleries feature: galleries page with informational content, Pic-Time CTA button, and navigation links in header (desktop + mobile) and footer</what-built>
  <how-to-verify>
1. Start dev server: `npx astro dev`
2. Navigate to http://localhost:4321/galleries/
3. Verify page content:
   - h1 "Client Galleries" heading
   - Intro paragraph about password-protected galleries
   - "How It Works" section with 3 feature cards (View and Share, Download, Select Favourites)
   - "Accessing Your Gallery" section with numbered steps
   - CTA button "Access Your Gallery" -- click it and confirm it opens simonwickes.pic-time.com in a NEW TAB
   - "New client?" note with link to /contact/
4. Toggle dark mode -- verify all text remains legible, no invisible elements
5. Check desktop nav: "Client Galleries" link visible between Services dropdown and Contact
6. Resize to mobile width (< 1024px): open hamburger menu, verify "Client Galleries" link in slide-in panel
7. Scroll to footer: verify "Galleries" link present
8. Click "Client Galleries" in nav from any other page (e.g., /contact/) -- verify it navigates to /galleries/ and shows active state
  </how-to-verify>
  <resume-signal>Type "approved" or describe any issues with layout, content, dark mode, or navigation</resume-signal>
