<objective>
Create the FAQ data module and standalone FAQ page with 10+ questions covering booking, pricing, process, and deliverables for Simon Wickes Photography.

Purpose: The FAQ page reduces friction for potential clients by answering common questions upfront, and reduces repetitive inquiry emails for Simon. It is a standalone page linked from the contact page and navigation.
Output: TypeScript FAQ data file following the services.ts pattern, and a fully styled FAQ page at /faq/.

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 1: Create FAQ data module</name>
  <files>src/data/faq.ts</files>
  <action>
Create `src/data/faq.ts` following the established pattern from `src/data/services.ts`:

1. Define a `FAQItem` interface with:
   - `question: string`
   - `answer: string`
   - `category: 'booking' | 'process'`

2. Export a `faqItems` array with 12+ questions. Split roughly evenly between 'booking' and 'process' categories.

**Booking & Pricing questions (6+ items):**
- How far in advance should I book? (recommend 3-6 months for weddings/events, shorter for portraits)
- What are your prices / How do you structure pricing? (custom quotes based on project scope, mention a free consultation)
- Do you require a deposit? (yes, to secure the date)
- What is your cancellation/rescheduling policy? (reasonable, mention weather rescheduling for outdoor shoots)
- Do you travel for shoots? (yes, cover the local area and available for destination work)
- What happens if the weather is bad for an outdoor shoot? (reschedule or find sheltered locations, flexible approach)
- How do I book a session? (use the contact form, describe what you are looking for, Simon will follow up)

**Process & Deliverables questions (6+ items):**
- How long until I receive my photos? (typical turnaround: 2-4 weeks depending on project scope)
- How many photos will I receive? (depends on session type, give ranges: portraits 30-50, weddings 300-500, events 100-200)
- Do you provide raw/unedited images? (no, all images are professionally edited)
- Can I print the photos myself? (yes, full-resolution files provided for personal printing)
- What should I wear / how should I prepare? (tips vary by shoot type, Simon provides a prep guide after booking)
- Do you offer photo albums or prints? (focus is on digital delivery via client galleries, but can recommend print partners)
- What equipment do you use? (professional camera and lens kit, mention backup equipment for events/weddings)
- How do I receive my final images? (password-protected online gallery with download access)

Answers should be 2-4 sentences each. Tone: warm, professional, helpful. Write from Simon's first-person perspective ("I" not "we").

3. Export a helper function `getFAQByCategory(category: FAQItem['category']): FAQItem[]` that filters by category.
  </action>
  <verify>
- File exists at `src/data/faq.ts`
- TypeScript compiles without errors: `npx astro check` or `npx tsc --noEmit`
- Contains 12+ FAQ items
- Both 'booking' and 'process' categories are represented
  </verify>
  <done>FAQ data module exports faqItems array with 12+ questions across booking and process categories, with typed FAQItem interface and getFAQByCategory helper.</done>
</task>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 2: Create standalone FAQ page</name>
  <files>src/pages/faq.astro</files>
  <action>
Create `src/pages/faq.astro` as a standalone page:

1. Import `PageLayout` from `@layouts/PageLayout.astro` and `faqItems` + `getFAQByCategory` from `@/data/faq`.

2. Page structure inside PageLayout (title="FAQ", description="Frequently asked questions about Simon Wickes Photography services, booking, pricing, and what to expect."):

```
<section class="mx-auto max-w-4xl px-6 py-16">
  <h1> -- "Frequently Asked Questions" (font-display, text-4xl, font-bold, tracking-tight, mb-4)
  <p> -- Brief intro: "Everything you need to know about working with me. Can't find what you're looking for? Get in touch." with link to /contact/

  <div> -- Booking & Pricing section
    <h2> -- "Booking & Pricing" (font-display, text-2xl, font-bold, mb-6, mt-12)
    {getFAQByCategory('booking').map(item => FAQ item)}
  </div>

  <div> -- Process & Deliverables section
    <h2> -- "Process & Deliverables" (font-display, text-2xl, font-bold, mb-6, mt-12)
    {getFAQByCategory('process').map(item => FAQ item)}
  </div>

  <div> -- CTA at bottom
    <p> -- "Still have questions?" with link to /contact/ page
  </div>
</section>
```

3. Each FAQ item renders as a simple question + answer pair (NOT accordion):
   - Question: `<h3>` with `text-lg font-semibold mb-2 text-surface-900 dark:text-surface-100`
   - Answer: `<p>` with `text-surface-600 dark:text-surface-400 mb-8 leading-relaxed`

4. Style the "Get in touch" links as inline text links with accent color: `text-accent-500 hover:text-accent-600 dark:text-accent-400 dark:hover:text-accent-300 underline`

5. The bottom CTA section should have a top border separator (`border-t border-surface-200 dark:border-surface-800 pt-8 mt-12`) and include a link styled as a button to the contact page (matching the accent button style used elsewhere in the site).
  </action>
  <verify>
- `npm run build` succeeds
- Page renders at `/faq/` in dev server (`npm run dev`)
- All FAQ items are visible (no accordion/collapse behavior)
- Questions are grouped by category with section headings
- Links to /contact/ are present (intro text + bottom CTA)
  </verify>
  <done>FAQ page exists at /faq/ with 12+ questions grouped by Booking & Pricing and Process & Deliverables. All questions visible. Links to contact page present in intro and CTA.</done>
</task>
