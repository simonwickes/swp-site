<objective>
Verify the complete contact and FAQ experience: form layout, field interactions (event type Other toggle, submit spinner), validation error display, success state, FAQ page rendering, cross-page navigation, and dark/light mode appearance.

Purpose: Visual and functional verification ensures the contact flow works end-to-end before marking the phase complete. This catches layout issues, broken interactions, and styling inconsistencies that automated checks miss.
Output: Verified contact and FAQ pages ready for production.

  <name>Task 1: Automated build and structure verification</name>
  <files>src/pages/contact.astro, src/pages/faq.astro, src/components/contact/ContactForm.astro</files>
  <action>
Run a comprehensive set of automated checks:

1. `npm run build` -- full build must pass with zero errors
2. Start dev server and verify these pages return 200:
   - GET /contact/ (contact page with form)
   - GET /faq/ (FAQ page)
3. Verify the contact page HTML contains:
   - A `<form>` element with id="contact-form"
   - Input fields: name, email, eventType (select), eventDate, message (textarea)
   - Submit button with id="submit-btn"
   - Hidden success message div with id="success-message"
   - Text "24-48 hours" somewhere on the page
   - Link to "/faq/"
4. Verify the FAQ page HTML contains:
   - At least 12 `<h3>` elements (one per FAQ question)
   - Section headings for "Booking" and "Process" (or similar)
   - Link to "/contact/"
5. Verify the event type dropdown has 8+ options (one per service category) plus "Other"
6. Check for any console errors or warnings in the build output

Fix any issues found during verification. Common issues to watch for:
- Import path errors (ensure @/ aliases work correctly)
- Missing closing tags in Astro templates
- Dark mode classes missing on any element
- Build warnings about unused imports
  </action>
  <verify>
- `npm run build` passes with zero errors
- Both /contact/ and /faq/ pages return 200 in dev server
- HTML structure matches requirements
  </verify>
  <done>Build passes. Contact page has form with all fields, success/error states, and response time. FAQ page has 12+ questions in two categories. Both pages serve correctly.</done>
</task>

<task type="checkpoint:human-verify" gate="blocking">
  <what-built>Complete contact form with all fields (name, email, event type dropdown with Other, event date, message), inline validation, submit spinner, success/error states, and FAQ page with 12+ questions in two categories.</what-built>
  <how-to-verify>
1. Start dev server: `npm run dev`
2. Navigate to http://localhost:4321/contact/
3. Verify layout:
   - Page heading says "Get in Touch"
   - Response time mentioned (24-48 hours)
   - Link to FAQ page visible
   - Name and email fields side by side on desktop
   - Event type is a dropdown with all 8 service types + Other
   - Event date is a text input with placeholder
   - Message is a textarea
   - Submit button says "Send Message"
4. Test Event Type interaction:
   - Select "Other" from dropdown -- a free text input should appear
   - Select any other option -- free text input should hide
5. Test form submission (will fail with placeholder API key -- that's expected):
   - Submit empty form -- should show validation errors under name, email, message
   - Fill in valid data and submit -- button should show spinner briefly, then show an error (because RESEND_API_KEY is a placeholder)
6. Toggle dark mode -- all form elements should be readable with proper contrast
7. Navigate to http://localhost:4321/faq/
8. Verify FAQ page:
   - All questions visible (not collapsed/accordion)
   - Questions grouped by Booking & Pricing and Process & Deliverables
   - At least 12 questions total
   - Link to contact page present
   - Readable in both dark and light mode
9. Test navigation: click FAQ link on contact page -> FAQ loads. Click contact link on FAQ page -> contact page loads.
