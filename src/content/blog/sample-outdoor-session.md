There's something special about the light at Papago Park during golden hour...

## The Location

Papago Park offers incredible red rock formations that create a stunning backdrop for portraits.

## Working with Natural Light

We scheduled the session for 5:30 PM to catch the golden hour light filtering through the desert landscape.

### Tips for Outdoor Sessions

- Book sessions 1-2 hours before sunset
- Wear colors that complement the environment
- Comfortable shoes for walking to the best spots

The Smith family was wonderful to work with, and we captured some truly magical moments.
